# Email Notification System Setup

This guide will help you set up email notifications for booking confirmations and password reset functionality.

## Features Added

1. **Booking Confirmation Emails**: When an admin confirms a booking, the user receives a detailed email notification
2. **Forgot Password with OTP**: Users can reset their password using email OTP verification

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

The required dependencies have already been installed:
```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

### 2. Set Up Gmail for Sending Emails

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
   - Navigate to Security > 2-Step Verification > App passwords
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"
   - Copy this password (you'll need it for the configuration)

### 3. Configure Email Settings

1. **Copy the example configuration file**:
   ```bash
   cp config/email-config.example.js config/email-config.js
   ```

2. **Update the configuration** in `config/email-config.js`:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
       emailUser: 'your-actual-email@gmail.com',  // Your Gmail address
       emailPass: 'your-app-password',            // The app password you generated
       frontendUrl: 'http://localhost:3005'       // Your frontend URL
   };
   ```

3. **Add the config file to .gitignore** to keep your credentials secure:
   ```bash
   echo "config/email-config.js" >> .gitignore
   ```

### 4. Create Database Table

Run the SQL script to create the password reset OTP table:

```sql
-- Execute this in your Supabase SQL editor
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS password_reset_otps (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    otp VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    used_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_password_reset_otps_email ON password_reset_otps(email);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_password_reset_otps_expires ON password_reset_otps(expires_at);

-- Enable RLS and add policies
ALTER TABLE password_reset_otps ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Allow inserting OTP records" ON password_reset_otps
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow reading OTP records for verification" ON password_reset_otps
    FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow deleting used OTP records" ON password_reset_otps
    FOR DELETE USING (true);
```

### 5. Test the Setup

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test booking confirmation emails**:
   - Create a booking as a user
   - Login as admin and confirm the booking
   - Check if the user receives an email notification

3. **Test forgot password**:
   - Go to the login page
   - Click "Forgot Password?"
   - Enter your email and follow the OTP verification process

## Email Templates

### Booking Confirmation Email
- Beautiful HTML template with booking details
- Includes vehicle information, dates, times, and amounts
- Professional styling with RentHub branding

### Password Reset OTP Email
- Clean design with security warnings
- 6-digit OTP prominently displayed
- 10-minute expiration notice

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Authentication failed" error**:
   - Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular Gmail password
   - Ensure 2-Factor Authentication is enabled on your Gmail account

2. **"User not found" error**:
   - Check if the user exists in the database
   - Verify the email address is correct

3. **OTP not working**:
   - Check if the `password_reset_otps` table was created correctly
   - Verify the OTP hasn't expired (10 minutes)

4. **Emails not sending**:
   - Check your Gmail account for any security alerts
   - Verify the email configuration in `config/email-config.js`
   - Check server logs for detailed error messages

### Security Notes

- Never commit your `email-config.js` file to version control
- Use environment variables in production
- Regularly rotate your Gmail app passwords
- Monitor email sending logs for any suspicious activity

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints Added

1. **POST /api/forgot-password**
   - Request body: `{ "email": "user@example.com" }`
   - Sends OTP to user's email

2. **POST /api/reset-password**
   - Request body: `{ "email": "user@example.com", "otp": "123456", "newPassword": "newpass" }`
   - Verifies OTP and updates password

### Modified Endpoints

1. **POST /api/admin/bookings/:id/confirm**
   - Now sends email notification when booking is confirmed
   - Includes detailed booking information in the email
